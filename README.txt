//This project used a TI MSP430 Microcontroller that was programmed using C code in Code Composer Studio.
The goal was to use this microcontroller to create a portable heart rate monitor using low energy bluetooth. A FIR filter 
was implemented to filter the raw EKG signal and extract its most important source features.
